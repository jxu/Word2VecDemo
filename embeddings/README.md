Additional embeddings that can be used with the demo.
Demo needs to be refactored to switch between embeddings (see issue #32 for more details)
Current status:
1. GloVe embeddings: 3 different dimensions, taken from 3 different sources (can be observed in file names)
2. BERT embeddings: not worked on yet, will link findings here.
