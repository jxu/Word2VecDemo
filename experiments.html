<h5> Basic Exploration </h5>

The left half of the demo window is the 3D point plot.  The right half
is the semantic feature vector display.  At the bottom of the window
there are expandable panels that can be opened to reveal more advanced
features.<p/>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Explore the 3D point plot:</b> Click and drag in the point
    plot to rotate the view.  Use the scroll wheel to zoom in or out.
    Hold down the control key and click and drag to pan the view.<p/>

  <li> <b>Find closest words:</b> Put the mouse pointer over a word in
    the 3D plot.  A window will pop up showing the 10 closest words to
    this one.<p/>

  <li> <b>Explore the feature vector display:</b> The feature vector
    display in the right half of the window shows the embedding
    vectors for up to six selected words.  Drag the mouse over the
    colored bars in the display and you can read out the exact value
    of each bar.  The current column the mouse is over is magnified
    and shown to the left of the main display.  Column 126 correlates
    with gender; it is tan/orange for male words and gray/blue for
    female words.<p/>

  <li> <b>Activate a word.</b> Click on a point in the 3D plot.  This
  becomes the "active" point and its color switches to red.<p/>

  <li> <b>Copy the active word to the feature vector display.</b>
    When a point is active, you can click on one of the slots in the
    feature vector display and that word's vector will be copied into
    the slot, replacing the previous contents.  The word will also be
    deactivated.<p/>

  <li> <b>Add/remove words from the 3D plot.</b> Type a word in the
    text box below the 3D plot to add it to the plot.  Adding a word
    also makes it the active word.  If a word is already present in
    the plot, typing that word in the box deletes it from the plot.
    <p/>

  <li> <b>Compare word similarity via dot product.</b>
    <p/>

</ul>
